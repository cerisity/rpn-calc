# rpn-calc
# Basic stack based reverse polish notation calculator that calculates the sum of 2 numbers from a string input

The program can be run by running a.exe, or you can recompile it yourself if you don't trust me

The debug code is uncommented by default, this is so that you can see how the calculator is working
You can find the debug lines (they are signposted) and add comments infront of them to remove this
